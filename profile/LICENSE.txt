Everyone in CSWCSS Robotics Team is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

  Robotics Team members strives to construct technical pillars and laid foundations for the
succession of this organization. One of the strategy is to adopt open-source materials to lower
production cost. Another strategy is to restrict inheritance of resources to successors.

  This license is made available to all CSWCSS Robotics Team members only, because all materials
released under this license are restricted to internal exchange only, which would be detailed in
section 1.

  Materials are released under this license for two goals: (1) To maintain Robotics Team
technological superiority and hence sustainability of robotics events in CSWCSS; (2) To protect
Robotics Team members from facing legal charges against them for redistributing any materials to the
external public without the awareness to comply with the original respective licenses of those
materials.

  Robotics Team is facing a declining amount of available resources, since the nature of robotics
education does not easily visualize and quantize its outcomes. Robotics Team superiority is required
to make robotics events more sustainable in this school.

  Robotics Team uses a wide range of open-source materials. Most of them give a rather permissive
license such as MIT or BSD or unlicensed, which restricts basically nothing except retaining the
license notices and crediting appropriate owners and their respective copyrights. However, there are
very strict copyleft licenses such as GPL that prohibits redistribution of embedded or modified
materials without accompanying the source, but allows internal redistributions and modifications
within an organization. By treating the Robotics Team as a student organization, such act would be
allowed within the legally appropriate usage of the material. To protect Robotics Team members from
legal charges due to accidental misuse of GPL or LGPL or other copyleft licensed materials, Robotics
Team members are mostly denied to publish materials under this license.

  It is very common for people to modify open-source materials but not disclosing their modified
versions to the public, given that such materials are not distributed in a closed-source manner.
A common example is that students copy and modify open-source code and use such code in their robots
to join robotics commpetitions. These students do not distribute their modified version in a
closed-source manner, so they need not disclose their modified versions to the public. This is
allowed by open-source licenses including MIT, BSD, GPL and LGPL. This license requires Robotics Team
members to exercise this confidential right for most of the time.

  If you, as a Robotics Team member, do not wish to be bounded by the terms and conditions of this
license, may develop your own version of the hardware and software involved, so you have
copyright over your own creations, hence you could license your creations by your own choice. By
doing so, you also get the most out of Robotics Team, because you need to take in all the technical
knowledge to rebuild layers of abstractions and learn the techniques to efficiently obtain useful
information from documentations and forum discussions and other kinds of human interaction.
  This is exactly what the 9th Term did in 2021 - 2023, to completely rebuild hardware and software
foundations and abstraction layers to cover the huge technical gap left by the discontinued support
of both hardware and software from a China STEM kit providing company.
  After years of development, we found out that Robotics Team don't have the time for each cohort to
rebuild everything from scratch, and this is due to some very complex reasons involving Hong Kong
education system, Robotics Team recruitment process, etc. not to be discussed here in detail. The
foundations of a robotics system need not be greatly changed for each cohort, so abstractions and
modularizations are implemented to reduce the workload for members on low-level development. Members
could instead focus on the high-level logic implementations, so they could improve the algorithms
hence performance efficiently without needing to take care of low-level debugging.
  The 9th Term faced a lot of difficulties in building and securing this foundation. Low-level bugs
always need to be resolved before proceeding on high-level development, which costed most of our
development time, making it barely possible to tune a robot for better performance in a competition.
We clearly understand that this is not an ideal development environment. The stressful atmosphere and
a deadline countdown is highly discouraging. Therefore, we decided to free our successors from this
pain by providing one more option for them to choose. They either use our prebuilt modules, or they
build their own new ones.
  Yet, we need to strike a balance between providing abstractions and encouraging members to learn.
Robotics R&D is all about scheduling, division of labour, modularizations, team cooperations,
adapting to new technologies. All of this must be challenging to a secondary school student, so feel
free to put some pressure on yourself. Task management, stress management, team leadership, there is
a lot for you to learn as a member, not just some bare metal technical details.

0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 1 of the Robotics and Electronics Club And Robotics Team Internal
Resource Exchange License.

"A file" refers to a collection of data viewed as a minimum data storage unit by the file system,
regardless of the file type and its permissions to be read, written and executed.

"A folder" refers to a collection of files viewed by the file system. A folder is said to "contain"
a file if that file belongs to the collection of the folder.

"Materials under this license" refers to the folder containing this license, all of its files,
folders and subfolders and their containing files, except those folders and subfolders containing
another license and contents under those folders and subfolders. A file or folder inside the folder
containing this license is automatically licensed under this license if it does not belong to the
stated exception, even the file or folder does not contain an explicit declaration of its licensing
information at the beginning of its contents.

"Robotics Team", "the team" refers to CSWCSS Robotics Team.

"Robotics Team member" refers to an official member of the Robotics Team who (1) has passed through
rigorous team entry selections, and (2) is registered on the "Robotics Team member namelist" to be
submitted to the Teacher Advisor of Robotics Team at the beginning of every CSWCSS academic year.
This includes any previously active Robotics Team members who were not deprived of this title until
their last day of study in CSWCSS. There are some rare cases: CSWCSS students who were once Robotics
Team members, and withdrew from the team, both actively or passively, are no longer considered
"Robotics Team members".

"Active Robotics Team member" refers to a Robotics Team member who (1) is a CSWCSS student at that
considered time period, and (2) engages in or has been engaged in robotics activities led by the
Robotics Team.

2. Prohibited Actions

a. Publications to External Public
You may not publish any materials under this license or any parts of them to the external public as a
Robotics Team member. If asked, you should state clearly that you could not provide any of these
materials to them, as restricted by confidential policies of Robotics Team. You need not explain what
kind of license or agreement was made.

i. Exceptions
Under some unpredictable situations not prescribed in this license, Robotics Team members may have
emergency needs to publish or submit any materials under this license or any parts of them to whoever
concerned, including the external public. This license grants permission to each active Robotics Team
member to do so, under a specific condition: At least 2 other active Robotics Team members agree such
act. Under such circumstances, section 1c, 1d and 2a are overriden by the exception stated in
subsection 2ai. However, Robotics Team members should use his (or her) best efforts to prevent such
materials falling into the hands of irrelevant persons.

3. Disclosure of Materials Under This License

a. Validity of This License Under Proper Disclosure
For any materials under this license published or submitted under section 1d or 2ai, this license
automatically voids, which means this license does not take any effect to the recipient. However,
the recipient should be aware that some files and folders and subfolders and their files are under
other licenses. These licenses are not covered by the scope of this license, so these licenses remain
valid, and hence applicable to the recipient.

b. Validity of This License Under Improper Disclosure
For any materials under this license published or submitted outside the scope defined by section 1d
and 2ai, you may not use any materials under this license or any parts of them as an external public.
If you have doubts of the copyright owner distributing the wrong copy to you, please see section 3c.

c. Dual-licensing
For some reasons, the copyright owner of a material may wish to license his (or her) materials in
more than one license. It is up to the owner's decision on when and how to publish which copy under
which license and terms and conditions. You may contact the copyright owner to ask if him (or her)
provides an alternative licensing option rather than this license, for the considered materials. He
(or she) has the absolute freedom to whether or not provide you a copy of the materials under another
license, subject to possibly other terms and conditions.

4. Convey of Ideas

Despite the lack of permission to display materials under this license or any parts of them to the
external public, you may convey the ideas present in the materials to the external public at your
discretion, given that such decision is made after thorough thought of whether this message would
cause serious leakage of Robotics Team core technologies or expose security vulnerabilities to the
external public.

5. Agreement

This license acts as a confidential agreement. However, you cannot manually sign this license or
accept it. By using a material under this license or any parts of it, you automatically accept the

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the Robotics Team, the best way to achieve this is to
make it Robotics Team software which every inheriting member can use
and modify under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
